React Horizontal Page Progress is a small React component.
It is designed for showing scrolling page progress on the top of your page.

Using it is simple. Inside project folder, open terminal and type following command:

npm i react-horizontal-page-progress

Then inside screen component where you would like to use it, just import it.

import HorizontalPageProgress from "react-horizontal-page-progress";

Component uses only two props:

height: When using component, you should tell it by passing prop height what it's height should be - '10px' - for example...
backgroundColor: Also, pass to component what color should it be.

Example usage:

```
<HorizontalSlider
 height="1px"
 backgroundColor="red"
/>
```
